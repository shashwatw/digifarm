## üìÑ ABSTRACT
Blockchain can preserve an incorruptible, decentralised, and transparent record of all the data, and so it is a great fit for for all kinds of applications. Furthermore, on one side, blockchain is a transparent system, but it is also private, hiding any individual's identity behind complicated and secure codes that can preserve the sensitivity of the data. The technology's decentralised shape also enables the farmers and the goverment to communicate the same information in a secure and timely manner without the unnecessary involvement of people in between who are likely to manipulate the information.

## üóíÔ∏è INTRODUCTION
This project effectively stores the crop data fed by the farmers on the blockchain network.Nowadays, we see many middlemen deceiving the farmers by reducing the fares of their crop thereby, they themselves earn more through commission.Therefore, the farmer does not get what he deserves. So to keep all the data secure and transparent we have created a two portals based on blockchain technology, one for the farmer to give the necessary data as inputs which will be stored on the government's database and the second portal for the government where the government can approve the data and take necessary actions after manual checking of the crop quality.

The flowchart above depicts how our solution will work. First the farmer will be asked to register if not registered yet.The registration process asks for basic details such as name, aadhaar number, crop, produce, etc.If the farmer is already registered on the digifarm portal, then he can feed their produce and other required data to the government through the farmer portal and this is how the data will be sent, directly to the government‚Äôs database without any modifications. On the other hand, once the government receives the data in its database the quality of the produce can be verified manually and, if approved, the necessary actions can be taken and a certificate in the form of an NFT will be generated at the farmer‚Äôs end.
In this way, there will be direct exchange of data between the farmer and the government. Hence there would be transparency, the costs forced by the middlemen would be completely eliminated, and the method is secure and trustworthy since there is no involvement of any third-party services.

### üîë KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network hence, there would be no possibility to manipulate the data
- Once the crop details are entered then no one can modify them
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network
- Since there can be no manipulation of data, the entire system is trustworthy and there is transparency
- The cost to the farmer which served as a commissions to the middlemen, would be completely eliminated

### üåà CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of injustice which sometimes, the middlemen do to the farmers.

### FUTURE PROSPECTS
- To make our system more useful and convenient, we'll be hiring third-party services through which we can verify fields and production through satellite which will eliminate the need of manual checking of the data received from the farmer.
- Government will be able to send certificate to farmer through NFTs which will be unique for each application.
